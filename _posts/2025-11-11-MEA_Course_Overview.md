# #Metadata

## Instructors
- Parin Chaipunya, KMUTT, Bangkok (parin.cha[at]kmutt.ac.th)
- Michel De Lara, École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, Paris (michel.delara[at]enpc.fr)

## Course objectives
- Capacity building. Prepare the practitioners for the current and new trends on energy management that involves more 
and more unpredictable elements --- demand, availability of renewable resources, etc.
<!---->
<!-- ## Prospective attendees -->
<!-- - Fluent in calculation. -->
<!-- - Motivated, not afraid to ask questions, and ready for discussion. -->

## Course organization
- A lecture in the morning of each day.
- In the afternoon, the attendees should prepare the problems from the MEA side to discuss and hopefully to frame them using stochastic optimization.

Modeling session

## Week 2 (Stochastic optimization. Part I)
Lecturers: Michel De Lara, Parin Chaipunya

### Monday 24 November 2025

#### Morning (08h30--11h30)
One-stage stochastic optimization. First examples.

##### Overview
This lecture covers the question of how to commit to produce energy for an uncertain demand.

#### Afternoon (12h30--15h30)
Modeling session

### Thursday 27 November 2025

#### Morning (08h30--11h30)
Two-stage stochastic optimization, scenario decomposition, Progressive Hedging.

##### Overview
How do you commit yourself to produce energy for an uncertain demand and when you can correct your first decision 
by a second decision mobilizing costly energy after the demand has been revealed.
How do you handle demand and production scenarios ?

#### Afternoon (12h30--15h30)
Modeling session

## Week 3 (Stochastic optimization. Part II)
Lecturers: Michel De Lara, Parin Chaipunya

### Monday 15 December 2025

#### Morning (08h30--11h30)
Introduction to multi-stage stochastic optimization, Bellman equation

##### Overview
Answers the question of how to manage a storage (dam, battery) when you make sequential decisions (charge/discharge 
sequence) on a given timespan, under unpredictable demand and renewable sources production.

#### Afternoon (12h30--15h30)
Modeling session

### Thursday 18 December 2025

#### Morning (08h30--11h30)
More advanced methods. Decomposition of large-scale stochastic optimization problems.
Risk measures and optimization.

##### Overview
How to both maximize profit and minimize risk.
Example of smart grid management with multiple storages located on a network. How to avoid high costs with low 
probability by using suitable risk measures.

#### Afternoon (12h30--15h30)
Modeling session
